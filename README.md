##Global Cancer Data Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring global cancer statistics, with a focus on understanding the impact of environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors on cancer severity and treatment costs, as well as computing incidence rates across different countries.

1-Project Overview:

This project involves analyzing a dataset from Kaggle containing patient-level cancer data from various countries. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract meaningful insights and patterns.

2-Dataset Description:

The dataset includes the following columns:

Original Columns:

Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient

Age: Patient's age

Gender: Male/Female

Country_Region: Country or region of the patient

Air Pollution: Level of air pollution exposure

Alcohol Use: Level of alcohol consumption

Cancer Type: Type of cancer diagnosed

Genetic Risk: Genetic predisposition to cancer

Obesity Level: Obesity level of the patient

Smoking: Smoking habits

Survival Years: Number of years the patient survived after diagnosis

Target Severity Score: Severity score of the cancer case

Treatment Cost: Cost of treatment

Year: Year of diagnosis


3-Added Columns:

Cases: Number of cancer cases per country

Population: Population of each country

Rate: Cancer incidence rate per 100,000 population


4-Objectives

Identify key factors influencing cancer severity

Explore geographic and demographic patterns of cancer incidence

Analyze the relationship between treatment cost and severity/risk factors

Calculate and visualize cancer incidence rates globally

Provide insights to support healthcare policies and prevention strategies


5-Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Power BI / Tableau

Excel

SQL


6-Expected Outcomes

Correlation matrix showing relationships between risk factors and severity

Heatmaps and bar charts visualizing cancer incidence by country and region

Interactive dashboards with treatment cost analysis

Country-level incidence rate maps


7-Notes

Data preprocessing included handling missing values, normalizing formats, and adding calculated fields (cases, population, rate) to enhance analysis.
